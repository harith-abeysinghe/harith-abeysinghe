# Harith Abeysinghe

Backend-focused Software Engineer with strong interests in **distributed systems**, **event-driven architectures**, and **cloud-native platforms**.  
Computer Engineering graduate from the University of Peradeniya.

I enjoy building systems where correctness, performance, and observability matter — particularly microservices, data pipelines, and Kubernetes-based platforms. I’m especially interested in how AI techniques can be applied to optimize system behavior under real-world constraints.

## What I Build

- Event-driven microservices using Apache Kafka  
- Low-latency backend systems and data synchronization pipelines  
- Cloud-native applications deployed on Kubernetes  
- Backend APIs with a focus on performance, reliability, and clean design  
- Systems with strong observability using metrics, tracing, and logs

## Research & Systems Work

### AI-Driven Latency-Constrained Resource Scaling in Kubernetes

Final year research exploring adaptive resource management in Kubernetes environments.

- Designed and evaluated dynamic scaling strategies under strict latency constraints  
- Instrumented microservices using Prometheus for workload and performance analysis  
- Experimented with learning-based and heuristic approaches for resource allocation  
- Deployed and tested microservices in Kubernetes clusters under controlled load  

**Technologies:** Kubernetes, Docker, Python, Java, Prometheus
